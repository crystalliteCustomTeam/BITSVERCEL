                <p class="font-s3 line-h font-fam1 font-w4 text-c color-2 possible open">BitsWits devised an application Easy Ride, a ride-hailing app allowing users to quickly and conveniently hail a ride from their smartphone. With Easy Ride, users can easily select the type of vehicle they want, book it in advance or at the last minute, and track their driver's progress until they reach their destination. Easy Ride also provides riders with an easy-to-navigate interface with all the necessary information about the ride, including driver ratings and estimated wait times. Easy Ride makes booking a ride simple and hassle-free. After downloading the app and registering an account, riders can select their pickup location and destination, as well as any additional stops along the way. Once this is done, Easy Ride will display the fare and estimated time of arrival before the rider confirms their ride.</p>
