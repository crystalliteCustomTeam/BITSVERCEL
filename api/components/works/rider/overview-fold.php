                            AS Medicare has been operating as a local pharmacy in the USA since 1965. The company takes great pleasure in providing
                            timely service and giving patients a one-stop shop for their medication requirements. Among the many services offered by
                            AS Medicare, some of the most common ones are terminal illness care services, medication synchronization, and drug
                            flavoring.

                            However, the company lagged in showing everything it had to offer, making sales, and driving visitors to its pharmacy
                            websites. To reach a wider audience and eventually boost sales, they contacted a reputable IT firm, BitsWits, to work
                            with them on developing a prescription delivery app.

                            Today, the need for healthcare apps has grown significantly, and the creation of mobile healthcare applications has
                            emerged as one of the industry's most prominent trends in recent years. The amazing portfolio of BitsWits convinced AS
                            Medicare to use our specialized mobile app development service to accomplish its objective.

                            BitsWits is one of the top pharma app development companies in the USA, thanks to its domain knowledge and background in

                            AS Medicare recognized the need for widely accessible, digitally accessible e-health products for all patients,
                            irrespective of patient's age, level of digital literacy, or physical or mental impairments that prevent them from
                            taking full advantage of an app's features. Therefore, we created a capable, user-friendly, and resource-adaptive pharma
                            app.

                            Most people are probably accustomed to receiving notifications when a smartphone or an app needs to be updated. Specific
                            updates are imperative to provide the optimum app experience. The same principles apply to the pharmacy and other apps.
                            Unfortunately, many pharmacy app manufacturers usually take a "one-and-done" method, meaning: they create an app but
                            don't continue to maintain it or make it user-friendly. As a result, even if the manufacturers make updates, the app
                            doesn't change.
                        </p>

                            Sooner or later, the software on patients' cell phones won't work properly, and, in some cases, they might not download
                            it at all. In other words, such app manufacturers are essentially paying money for a product that none of their clients
                            can use. The same was the case with AS Medicare. Though the company created and launched the app, but failed to keep the
                            app updated according to the modern trends and developments in the pharmaceutical sector. Not to mention the
                            pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated, and AS Medicare had to ensure that the app adhered to all legal laws and
                            regulations.
