                                In addition to prescription status updates and refill requests, the AS Medicare application offers extra features to
                                entice users to continue using it. A few prominent features include the addition of helpful health news stories,
                                medication lists for anyone linked to the account, alarms to remind patients when to take their medications, and the
                                provision of patient-friendly information.

                                Our professionals built the app and created the feature of secure two-way messaging. Through the app's encrypted two-way

                                from drug queries to pick-up directions. While we understand that some of this time is now needed for message
