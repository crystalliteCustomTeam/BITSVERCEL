                                When <b>FoodGrid</b> first approached us with this idea, our highly qualified crew members, with a wealth of expertise and proven experience in creating different apps, were delighted to join the project. Since creating an app with features like a reward/discount program, food delivery GPS, order history, and payment methods is a creative idea, our professionals were fully prepared to turn the idea, which was initially a light bulb above the head, into reality.
                                </p>
                                <p class="f-14 f-b f-400">Our professionals abandoned the conventional app development method and implemented modern practices. They introduced features such as the request to add multiple locations, advance order, and suggestions of alternate places, to create an app that would satisfy all the user's needs.</p>

                                For customers to navigate through various food outlets effortlessly, <b>FoodGrid</b> primarily needed a food delivery app with location-based map data. For this purpose, our professionals kept the sign-in and sign-up options simple. This way, customers can quickly type in their contact details and update them whenever they wish to.
                                </p>
                                <p class="f-14 f-b f-400">Over and above, the app our professionals created offered quick and straightforward browsing features. Since the app's success hinges on a variety of factors; therefore, we took care of all these factors. <b>FoodGrid</b> had very precise requests for each function in the app, and we were able to meet all of them.</p>

                                Most meal delivery apps don't provide sales or discounts on purchases. There are apps out there that neglect to prioritize discounts (you probably are oblivious about these apps).</p>
                                <p class="f-14 f-b f-400 mb-2">Since free items are always customers' favorite, why not give them priority? Specifically, our client asked for this unique feature to be added to the app. Therefore, we introduced this feature. Customers can easily view promotions on their profile page and in the header section.</p>
                                <p class="f-14 f-b f-400">The previous price is removed from every screen where it is shown, and the current price is made more visible by being highlighted in red color. Also, customers have the option to turn off the discounts option.</p>

                                Needless to say, payments are essential to every enterprise. Despite being the last stage in the order placement process, clients often cancel their orders if they encounter an issue. Some customers even choose not to try again.</p>
                                <p class="f-14 f-b f-400">Therefore, our professionals made sure that all payment methods are available and listed on the food delivery app for the payment process to be highly efficient and simple.</p>

                                It goes without saying that every business values customer since they are the ones who ultimately purchase products or services. Thatâ€™s why professionals at BitsWits implemented a review and rating option on the application. This way, customers would benefit from being able to rate and review different restaurants based on the listed food on the app.
