                            CS PHARMA – Since 1965, CS Pharma has served as a locally operated community pharmacy in the USA. They pride themselves
                            on offering prompt and courteous service and offer patients a one-stop shop for all of their pharmaceutical needs.
                            Long-term care services, medication synchronization, and medicine flavoring are just a few of the many services offered
                            by CS Pharma. But when it came to showcasing everything they have to offer, gaining sales and generating traffic for
                            their pharmacy websites, their online presence fell short.

                            This was when they tried to reach a reliable tech company to help them build a prescription delivery app with the goal
                            of reaching a wider audience and ultimately increasing sales. Notably, the need for Healthcare applications has
                            increased dramatically, and mobile application development for healthcare has emerged as one of the most promising
                            developments in recent years. After reviewing BitsWits’s incredible portfolio, CS Pharma decided to take our
                            customized mobile app development service to achieve its goal.

                            BitsWits’s domain expertise and prior experience make it one of the best pharma app development companies in
                            the USA. The mobile app development team has spent years designing and developing innovative mobile apps for retail and
                            pharmaceutical customers. The business we partnered with provides a wide range of clinical and pharmacy services for all
                            patients. They develop innovations that will fuel direct-to-patient health care in the future and provide comfort that
                            prioritizes patients. They saw the need for broadly available, digitally accessible e-health products for all patients,
                            regardless of their age, level of digital literacy, or physical or mental limitations that hinder them from utilizing
                            all app capabilities. So we had to design an app that is proficient, user friendly and resource adaptive as well.

                            Challenges
                        </h2>

                            If you own a smartphone, you are probably used to receiving notifications telling you when your phone or an app needs to
                            be updated. To ensure the best app experience, certain changes are necessary. Pharmacy and other business apps work the
                            same way. Unfortunately, many pharmacy app vendors frequently adopt a one-and-done strategy, which means they develop an
                            app but fail to keep it updated and user-friendly afterwards. Because of this, your app remains unchanged even though
                            the phone manufacturer releases updates on a regular basis. The software won't function properly on your patients'
                            smartphones sooner or later, or worse, they might not be able to download it at all. In essence, you are spending cash
                            on a product that none of your patients can even utilize. So the biggest challenge was to keep the one-and-done approach
                            away and work on the smooth functionality and sustainability of the app.
