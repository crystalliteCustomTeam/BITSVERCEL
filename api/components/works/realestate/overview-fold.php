                            Real estate apps have a significant impact on how tech-savvy consumers choose their next home. The US National
                            Association of Realtors reports that 51% of purchasers started their search for a home online. Brick Properties, like
                            other businesses, realized it was crucial to make sure real estate brokers incorporated solid real estate UX design
                            standards into apps as the home purchase has become more digital, especially after the Covid19 era. This is the reason
                            they contacted perfectdesignhub.com to design the Real Estate App. We have developed real estate apps, so we are aware
                            of how crucial a user-friendly design is for this business. Our research & experience demonstrate the importance of
                            strong UX principles for luring and keeping visitors. Moreover, they wanted round-the-clock in-app communication and
                            thus enhanced interactivity.

                            Due to their expertise in the field, the team at bitswits.co aimed to develop the Brick Properties Real Estate
                            Application, which would provide a detailed list of properties for sale as well as tools and information to help users
                            make wise real estate decisions. A platform where anyone could look for their ideal home, rent a property, or even sell
                            one. In addition to focusing on the buying and selling of properties, we wanted to create an app that provides essential
                            information on real estate trends and factors to take into account when dealing with real estate properties. A single
                            location where people may go for all of their housing-related needs and easily access a wide range of housing options.

                            Brick Properties needed an online platform where people could easily access affordable homes and sell any property. This
                            platform had to cater perfectly to all types of property requirements. It required a mobile application that allowed
                            users to look for their ideal homes while on the go. They needed a simple app that would keep them informed of all
                            available deals and the most recent real estate industry news. We were given the challenge to concentrate on the
                            navigational aspect with an exceptional user interface to portray properties in an exceptional way. Additionally, we
                            were tasked with educating users using a variety of tools that provided essential information about purchasing and
                            selling real estate, which was quite a challenge.
