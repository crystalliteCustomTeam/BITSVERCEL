                              their network in the USA. They are able to offer your neighborhood on-demand service. Their verified cleaners have years
                              of experience cleaning homes, offices, and public spaces. Additionally, they have staff that is completely trained,
                              contract-bound, and insured. By connecting vetted, qualified house cleaners with homeowners simply through the mobile
                              application, they hoped to transform the cleaning industry in the USA for residential, commercial, and public
                              properties. This is why they emailed BitsWits and got a quotation

                              Today, the world is expanding quickly. An app streamlines the booking process for cleaning services for everyone,
                              increases customer opportunities, and increases cleaners' revenue. Our American customer asked us to create an
                              iOS and Android app for the country's citizens. The customer believed that in order for the cleaning industry to
                              transition from conventional reservations to immediate bookings, they would need to be more inventive. After struggling
                              to find cleaners and coordinate their arrival, he talked about the potential benefits of an app that links clients and

                              Due to their expertise in the field, the team at bitswits.co aimed to develop the Brick Properties Real Estate
                              Application, which would provide a detailed list of properties for sale as well as tools and information to
                              help users make wise real estate decisions. A platform where anyone could look for their ideal home, rent a property, or
                              even sell one. In addition to focusing on the buying and selling of properties, we wanted to create an
                              app that provides essential information on real estate trends and factors to take into account when dealing with real
                              estate properties. A single location where people may go for all of their housing-related needs and
                              easily access a wide range of housing options.

                              Bacteria Shield recognized that people were too busy with other, more essential jobs to spend time engaging in the
                              everyday house and business cleaning activities. Getting cleaning services from a reputable, competent
                              professional was difficult for the individuals. Hence, our client was looking forward to offering skilled cleaners who
                              can support their consumers with their cleaning requirements.
