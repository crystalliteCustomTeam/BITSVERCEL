                Real estate apps have a significant impact on how tech-savvy consumers choose their next home. The US National Association of Realtors reports that 51% of purchasers started their search for a home online. Mark Placek Properties, like other businesses, realized it was crucial to make sure real estate brokers incorporated solid real estate UX design standards into apps as the home purchase has become more digital, especially after the Covid19 era. This is the reason they contacted perfectdesignhub.com to design the Real Estate App. We have developed real estate apps, so we are aware of how crucial a user-friendly design is for this business. Our research & experience demonstrate the importance of strong UX principles for luring and keeping visitors. Moreover, they wanted round-the-clock in-app communication and thus enhanced interactivity.
