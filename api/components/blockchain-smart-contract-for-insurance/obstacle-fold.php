                                   enhances the possibility of fraudulent claims. This was our developersâ€™ most
                                   significant issue in figuring out how to identify fraud claims utilizing a wider

                                   Healthcare insurance is one of the most inefficient and fraud-prone industries today.

                                   so on because it contained PII data.

                                   developers had to explore ways to establish a permanent audit trail, automate claims
                                   processing, and digitally track and manage tangible assets to make the software
