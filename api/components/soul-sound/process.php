                <p class="font-s3 line-h font-fam1 font-w4 text-c color-2 most">The experienced team working at <strong>BitsWits</strong> assisted <strong>Soul Sound</strong> in music streaming app development. We developed wireframes and prototypes that enabled us to test potential solutions quickly and iteratively. Not only this, but we also came up with a feature for users to create and save custom playlists from resolving the concern regarding limited customization options. Additionally, <strong>Soul Sound</strong> now includes a curated music library that can be filtered and sorted according to genre, artist, or other criteria. It helps users find the perfect music for any occasion. </p>
