                <p class="font-s3 line-h font-fam1 font-w4 text-c color-2 possible open">Music-streaming mobile applications have been one of the most popular categories in the world of apps in recent years. This growing inclination towards music streaming is driven by the shift in music consumption behavior, where users prefer to listen to their favorite tracks on the go.</p>
                <p class="font-s3 line-h font-fam1 font-w4 text-c color-2 open">A music streaming company, <strong>Soul Sound</strong>, recently realized the need to develop an application that would cater to the needs of music enthusiasts. Although the company created a mobile application allowing users to access millions of songs, it lacked intuitive design and striking features. Hence, <strong>Soul Sound</strong> approached <strong>BitsWits</strong> to re-design and re-create a responsive app design that offers users a seamless and positive user experience.</p>
