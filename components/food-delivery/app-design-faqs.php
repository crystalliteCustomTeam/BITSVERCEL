                                        A food delivery app is a digital platform that enables users to order food from their favorite restaurants in the comfort of their own homes. The app allows customers to scour through menus and select items, then pay for the order online or via a secure payment system. Once the order is placed, a rider associated with the application will pick up the food from the food outlet and deliver it to the customer's door.
