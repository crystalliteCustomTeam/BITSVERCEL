                                        When developing an NFT Marketplace, having all information about NFTs

                                        Gas fees are necessary to effectively perform a transaction or execute a
                                        contract on
                                        the Ethereum blockchain network. So the key issue was to lower the transaction
                                        cost
                                        so that users could be free while putting less burden on their wallets.
