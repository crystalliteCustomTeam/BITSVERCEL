                            The music industry transformed the way we consume content, and this was made possible by streaming technology. 
                          	BitsWits is one of the best mobile app development companies adapting to new technologies and tackling all the
                            challenges to provide users with the best music experience. When Soulful Sound came across BitsWits, they
                            instantly hired our proficient developers to get the music streaming app that allows music lovers to play any track by
                            any singer right at the moment with just a click and provide access to any soundtracks available online. The project's
                            goal is to provide the streaming service with more features than the free experience.

                            Soulful Sound wanted to launch a music streaming app that would allow aspiring artists and musicians to upload songs and
                            connect with fans. They also wanted this app to be a go-to option for listeners who want to listen to music for free.
                            When Soulful Sound shared the idea with us, the highly proficient and skilled team of developers was eager to jump on
                            board. Since the idea was creative, our team of developers was ready to transform your musical idea into reality.

                            As there is a need for commuting services because of the hassle of life, EZ Ride aimed to build a platform for both
                            riders and drivers to connect them and provide flexibility on the prices. It was a challenge for the EZ Ride to adopt
                            the new technology trends and sustain itself in a competitive industry. It was challenging to come up with an app that
                            has custom features like a sign up option, negotiated pricing options, route options, vehicle search options, and many
                            more. BitsWits application development team has incorporated all the functionalities to make the riding
                            experience memorable for the user.
