                                    In order to meet the constantly increasing demand for cleaners—a growing workload without the need for any redesign or
                                    code refactoring—we have had to overcome a lot of obstacles. It was challenging to keep up with the performance without
                                    making any errors at that time because there were hundreds of enrolled users and millions of cleaners.

                                    is issued to another cleaner. It presented a substantial development challenge.
