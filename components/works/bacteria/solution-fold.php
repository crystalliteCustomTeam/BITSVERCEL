                            To begin with, our customer and the team at BitsWits engaged in a comprehensive brainstorming session to
                            understand their needs and company plan. We built the Bacteria Shield app, which makes household and business cleaning
                            services quick, dependable, and reasonably priced, based on our discussion.

                            The application we created made it easier for customers to schedule cleaning services for commercial, public, and
                            residential premises and check the status of the cleaners. Customers can view the cleaner(s)' current location in real-
                            time, and if the services are running late, they can substitute another cleaner. On recurring services, they might plan
                            cleaning on a regular basis for a particular day. The consumer can also add several sites for cleaning, and there are
                            other booking alternatives available.
