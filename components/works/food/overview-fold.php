                            The increasing inclination towards technology has changed almost every facet of life. And the food delivery industry is no different. Today, people order food, be it junk or homemade, to be delivered right to their doorstep. And this, in turn, has caused a substantial change in consumer preferences.

                            Nowadays, most, if not all, food outlets work in collaboration with food delivery companies to reach a wide range of audiences and expand their business. Given this, <b>FoodGrid</b>, a small-scale food delivery startup, approached <b>BitsWits</b> to design an attractive food application that enables customers to place meal orders from their favorite food chain. The company aimed to deliver food from all well-known restaurants expeditiously. Besides, <b>FoodGrid</b> desired to provide a positive user experience to the customers.

                            <b>FoodGrid</b> contacted <b>BitsWits</b> to design and create a food delivery application for their business. It took approximately three months to turn this concept into execution. Not to mention the real-time tracking feature was also included in the food delivery app for the ease of customers.

                            The product was immediately released on the market through the Google Play Store to determine demand and confirm the concept before being made accessible in the app store. To help the company draw in new customers and maintain the existing ones, <b>BitsWits</b> developed an app that provided a straightforward ordering experience. Our experts ensured that the app was glitch-free and offered a positive and seamless user experience.

                            The main difficulties we had to contend with during the execution of the project included: <i>the project environment, technical difficulties</i>, and <i>time limitations</i>. The client asked that menu items display the list based on previous orders or searches. Even though our developer had little trouble with it, with the help of another, more skilled developer, we successfully completed the project on time.
