                            The app has cutting-edge UX design and listing technologies that let purchasers look at houses on a map. For instance,
                            purchasers might look at the property's pricing history to gain a better sense of the area's resale value. Additionally,
                            it offers Snap & Search, a special function that bases recommendations on a user's photo of their ideal home.

                            We provided users with advanced search options so they could quickly evaluate their desired properties based on various
                            categories. Nearly all apps practically require push notifications in order to communicate with your prospects or send
                            occasional industry news. Even better, you can inform users if prices change or a new property is added in a particular
                            area. This all leads to better user experience and customer retention ultimately.
