                                When Bliss Travels shared the idea with us, our highly skilled team of developers with extensive experience developing
                                mobile apps were eagerto jump on board. Since it's a creative idea to build an app having features like travel planning,
                                accommodation booking, extensive filtering options, cab & ticket booking, signup/ profile management, searching system,
                                chat with hosts, locating viewing, and review system, we were ready to transform your vision into reality by leaving the
                                traditional app development method behind and adopting the new one to build an app that would cater all the userâ€™s
                                needs.

                                Mainly, Brick Properties needed a property search app with location-based map data so users could easily browse through
                                different properties. We made the sign-in and sign-up options easy with Gmail and Facebook accounts. Moreover, the app
                                we developed provided smooth and easy browsing options. Features are always important in determining success. In order
                                to support XML layout files and map activity java files as best as possible, we developed a detailed Google map project
                                and used API keys. Each feature that Brick Properties wanted in the app was quite specific, and we were able to deliver
                                exactly what was required.

                                We had to provide different profiles for various groups of users because the options displayed for the buyer's profile
                                were very different from those for agents. While agents should also be able to view their own listings, schedules, and
                                lists of potential buyers, buyers should be able to access home listings, save favorites, and send inquiries. This all
                                helped in providing a good user experience and helped retain the customers too.
