                                We developed the app with secure two-way messaging features. Pharmacists and patients may communicate directly through
                                the app using encrypted 2-way chat, and they can rapidly respond to inquiries about anything from curbside pickup
                                directions to questions about prescription interactions. While our secure 2-way messaging solution has assisted
                                pharmacists in halving the time they spend on the phone, we are aware that some of this time is now required for message
                                transmission.
