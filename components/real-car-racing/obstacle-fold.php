                                   Graphics design is one of the key aspects and difficult challenges to overcome while
                                   developing a unique game. With games like car racing, UI/UX designers not only have
                                   to create different game interfaces but also an extensive set of graphic assets like
                                   car illustrations, effects visualizations, weapons icons and others, to offer a
                                   real-life racing experience. Content creation or can say graphics design is one of
                                   the biggest challenges with the real car racing game development.

                                   To keep players engaged, games must have several levels with progressively increasing
                                   difficulties. The advanced missions/challenges boost players to give their best and
                                   overcome infused obstacles. The challenging nature of the game increases playerâ€™s
                                   interest and engagement in the game. Therefore, creating obstacles illustrations
                                   remains a major task with the development of a car racing game.

                                   Optimized performance always remains a challenge for any development team since
                                   players do not like games with laggy performance and high loading time. And whenever
                                   that much graphical content is infused in a game, it becomes heavier. Therefore,
                                   ensuring top-notch performance always remains a challenging task for any development
