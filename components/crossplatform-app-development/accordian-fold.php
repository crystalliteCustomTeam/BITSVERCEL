                      “Cross-platform app development is the process of creating a single application that can run on multiple operating systems, such as iOS and Android.” This allows developers to create one version of their app for all users, rather than having to write code specifically for each platform. By utilizing cross-platform tools and frameworks, it makes it easier for companies to bring their apps to market faster and with fewer resources. It also provides the cross platform mobile app design and development agency with the opportunity to create a unified experience across all devices, regardless of platform.
