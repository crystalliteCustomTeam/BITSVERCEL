                                    The increasing inclination towards technology has changed almost every facet of
                                    life. And the food delivery industry is no different. Today, people order food, be
                                    it junk or homemade, to be delivered right to their doorstep. And this, in turn, has
                                    caused a substantial change in consumer preferences.
                                    Nowadays, most, if not all, food outlets work in collaboration with food delivery
                                    companies to reach a wide range of audiences and expand their business.
                                    <!-- Given this,
                                    FoodGrid, a small-scale food delivery startup, approached BitsWits to design an
                                    attractive food application that enables customers to place meal orders from their
                                    favorite food chain. The company aimed to deliver food from all well-known
                                    restaurants expeditiously. Besides, FoodGrid desired to provide a positive user
                                    experience to the customers. -->

                                    EZ Ride is a two-sided marketplace, a platform that connects drivers and riders,

                                    simple for two sides to connect and transact. EZ Ride earns money by collecting fees
                                    from gross bookings on the
                                    platform. The EZ Ride platform benefits from two-sided network effects. As more
                                    drivers join the platform, it becomes
                                    (to a certain extent) more valuable to riders (as they can find more route options,
                                    more pricing options, and lower wait
                                    times).
