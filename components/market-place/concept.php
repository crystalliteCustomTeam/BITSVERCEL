          The Concept Behind Mark Place

          Due to their expertise in the field, the team at bitswits.co aimed to develop the Mark Place Real Estate Application, which would provide a detailed list of properties for sale as well as tools and information to help users make wise real estate decisions. A platform where anyone could look for their ideal home, rent a property, or even sell one. In addition to focusing on the buying and selling of properties, we wanted to create an app that provides essential information on real estate trends and factors to take into account when dealing with real estate properties. A single location where people may go for all of their housing-related needs and easily access a wide range of housing options.
