                                        To ensure that the pharma app is user-friendly and intuitive for all users, including those with limited technical skills, you must consider the design and development of the app carefully. The navigation menu should be laid out, with fewer steps required to complete a task. Not only this, but the features should be easy to locate and understand without needing prior technical knowledge.
